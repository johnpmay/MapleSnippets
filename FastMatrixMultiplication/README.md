# Fast Matrix Multiplication

This is a collection of snippets related to verifying small matrix multiplication formulas published in 2022, and provides conversions of them to the format used by THE FMM catalog at https://fmm.univ-lille.fr/

The directory alphatensor contains Maple scripts to verify the matrix
multiplication formulas discovered by the DeepMind team's AlphaTensor project

KMtoFMM.mpl and KMtoFMM.ipynb are a script and a notebook that verify the
matrix multiplication formulas first reported by Kauers and Moosbauer in https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04045

KMtoFFM-AllFResults.mpl is a script properly generalized to rectangular matrixes in arbitrary characteristic that verifies all the results reported in https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01175
